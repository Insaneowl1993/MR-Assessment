# MR Frontend Developer Technical Test

## Description
This project involves creating a simple product details section for a clothing site with cart functionality to store a customerâ€™s product selections. The project comprises a client-side app developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Requirements
1. **Web Page Design:** A web page is provided based on the design prototype. The aim is to meet the basic design details without necessarily being "pixel-perfect".
2. **Responsive Design:** The site must fit different screen sizes, including large desktop and mobile designs.
3. **Add to Cart Functionality:** Customers can add a product with selected options (size) to a cart.
4. **Initial State:** When the page is first loaded, there is no size selected.
5. **Error Handling:** Clicking "Add to Cart" without selecting a size displays an error message.
6. **Cart Population:** Successfully adding a product to the cart will populate this sized product in the mini cart section.
7. **Unique Product Rows:** Only one row for each product size selected within the mini cart. Quantities will be updated as the product is added multiple times.
8. **Button Hover Effect:** The "Add to Cart" button changes color on hover with a 0.2-second transition to animate this.
9. **Mini Cart Display:** Customers can view a mini-cart of their selections.
10. **Product Information:** Product information will be consumed from the Product API.
